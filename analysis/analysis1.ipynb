    "I am interested in identifying the sectors or industries that are relatively stable and able to maintain or increase the value of investments, as well as those that are more volatile and therefore harder to predict. This is a crucial exercise for investors, as it can offer valuable insights that can aid in making more informed investment decisions. \n",

    "For instance, if an investor is interested in investing in the technology sector, it would be prudent to analyze the trends in that sector over a few years to gauge its performance and future prospects. Likewise, if an investor is assessing a specific company, having knowledge of its industry or sector's performance can provide essential context for evaluating the company's potential. By evaluating the performance of various industries and sectors over time, investors can pinpoint investment opportunities or risks and make informed decisions about where to allocate their capital.\n",
