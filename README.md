## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we have chosen was obtained from the popular website Kaggle which has multiple datasets of varying lengths from a large variety of topics. This dataset has data on the stock prices of the top 30 US companies from 2013 to 2023. The author has licensed this dataset through **public domain**, which enables everyone to freely use this data without being involved in legal problems. We believe that this dataset has the best data for an accurate analysis because the past decade has seen the greatest fluctuations in the stock market due to the rising number of tech giants and demand for e-commerce. The companies in this dataset have seen their stock prices increasing by several times, hence having a vast amount of data that can be used for analysis.
