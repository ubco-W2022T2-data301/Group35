# Introduction

There are many important things that is required to know before investing in stocks, this is informed in detail in the final report of the project. 

To start, Saketh was interested in how the visializations and analysis of datasets can be used to smartly invest in stocks without any risk of loss and more probability to maximize the returns and profits. This is a very important and useful information to always know as it primarily saves our money, especially during the infaltion and all the taxes. Suppose upon analysing 7 companies interested to invest in, there are 3 companies that show maximum return and success, then instead of fully investing in 1 place, it can be split and invested in 3 places so that it further reduces the risk of any loss.

We are interested in identifying the sectors or industries that are relatively stable and able to maintain or increase the value of investments, as well as those that are more volatile and therefore harder to predict. This is a crucial exercise for investors, as it can offer valuable insights that can aid in making more informed investment decisions.
We also noticed a growing public interest in index funds and a shift towards sustainable investing and I wonder whether these trends have been influenced by the performance of different sectors and if these companies are related to any sustainability practices.

Likewise, Vanshika was interested to explore more about the Exchange Traded Funds  Models as they are an important investment option due to their low-cost diversification, high liquidity, transparency, and flexibility in investment strategies. Further, they offer investors an efficient way to gain diversified exposure to a wide range of asset classes, while also being able to trade quickly and efficiently throughout the day, it adds more value in our project. The transparency of ETFs allows investors to make informed decisions about which ETFs to invest in and monitor their performance over time. ETFs also offer flexibility in terms of investment strategies, allowing investors to tailor their portfolios to their specific investment goals and risk tolerance. As such, ETFs have become an increasingly popular investment option for both individual and institutional investors. Due to these important factors, she analysis the data of all the tech industries and make the ETF baskets for the Yearly and Monthly basis.
